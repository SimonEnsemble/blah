metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are (often) crystalline materials that possess nanometer-sized cavities and exhibit large internal surface areas ($>$7000 m$^2$/g). 
this endows MOFs with the ability to selectively adsorb and concentrate gases into their pores/ on their internal surfaces, giving them applications in storing, separating, and sensing gases.
MOFs are synthesized modularly from molecular building blocks: organic linker molecules and inorganic nodes. 
owing to the abundance of compatible molecular building blocks and topologies in which they assemble, in addition to post-synthetic modifiability, the number of possible MOF structures is practically limitless. 
thus, we can search for MOF structures that are tailored to each particular application.
