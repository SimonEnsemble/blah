> I get the news I need on the weather report. - Simon (a different one) & Garfunkel

This page is dedicated to bragging about the accomplishments of students in our research ensemble!

## Jonathan will enroll in the Physics PhD program at the University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill

Jonathan Carney is officially headed to Chapel Hill-- in the Research Triangle-- to pursue his PhD in Physics! Huge congratulations, Jonathan!

Co-advised by Prof. David Roundy, Jonathan worked on developing a statistical mechanical model of gas adsorption in a metal-organic framework harboring a rotaxane molecular shuttle in its pores. See his paper in Langmuir [here](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c02839).

## Arthur will enroll in the Mathematical, Computational, and Systems Biology (MCSB) PhD program at UC Irvine

Arthur York is officially headed to Irvine in the fall to pursue his PhD in Mathematical, Computational, and Systems Biology! Huge congratulations, Arthur!

Arthur writes Julia code to carry out molecular simulations of gases adsorbed in nanoporous materials. See Arthur's (first-theory-author) [JACS paper](https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b05872) and his [blog post describing it](https://simonensemble.github.io/2019-07/Mo-cage-viz). Also see his [blog post on Buffon's needle](https://simonensemble.github.io/2018-04/buffon).

## Mira will enroll in PhD program in Chemical Engineering at UC Berkeley

Mira Khare is officially headed to Berkeley in the fall to pursue her PhD in Chemical Engineering! Huge congratulations, Mira!

Mira started off working on convolutional neural networks to predict the transcription driving capacity of gene promoters. Later, she focused on simulating the adsorption of gas in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) to predict their performance for methane storage and xenon/krypton separations.

## Árni $\mapsto$ Dr. Sturluson

huge congratulations to Dr. Árni Sturluson for earning a PhD in Chemical Engineering from Oregon State University, the first PhD student graduated from The Simon Ensemble! check out Arni's publications [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=k55bK2oAAAAJ&hl=en). we are proud of you, Árni, and we look forward to seeing your future accomplishments!

## Mira selected for the Future Leaders in Chemical Engineering symposium!

[Future Leaders in Chemical Engineering](https://www.cbe.ncsu.edu/research/future-leaders-in-chemical-engineering/) is a highly selective, national research symposium held at NC State University. Mira presented her research poster "Methane Adsorption Simulation Benchmarking in Metal Organic Frameworks".

## Melanie places first in paper competition at the PNW Regional AIChE conference and is awarded a national scholarship

Melanie Huynh took the first place prize for the paper competition at the PNW Regional AIChE conference! Her presentation was titled "Adsorbed xenon propellant storage: is adsorbent worth its weight?".
Also, Melanie was awarded the Othmer Senior National Scholarship from AIChE. Congratulations, Melanie!

## Rachel will enroll in PhD program in Mathematical, Computational & Systems Biology at UC Irvine

Rachel Sousa was accepted to and offered full funding for the Mathematical, Computational & Systems Biology PhD program at the University of California, Irvine ([link](https://ccbs.uci.edu/education/mcsb/)). Today, she accepted the offer. Congratulations, Rachel!

Rachel started off working on mathematical models of fairy circles and later focused on gas sensing. See her paper on framing gas sensing as an inverse problem [here](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssensors.0c02014).
