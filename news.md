This page is dedicated to bragging about the accomplishments of students in our research ensemble!

## Ping enrolls in Chemical Engineering PhD program at UMass Amherst

Ping Yang is officially headed to UMass Amherst in the fall to pursue his PhD in Chemical Engineering! Huge congratulations, Ping!

Ping led a project to build a machine learning model that classifies the toxicity of pesticides to honey bees, using random walk graph kernels and support vector machines. See [here](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/624b46a98048825306039fb0).

## Melanie enrolls in Chemical Engineering PhD program at UC Berkeley, awarded an NSF GRFP

Melanie Huynh is officially headed to Berkeley in the fall to pursue her PhD in Chemical Engineering! And, she was awarded the NSF [GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org)! Huge congratulations, Melanie!

Melanie led a project to develop a mathematical model of an adsorbed xenon storage tank for spacecraft propulsion, published in _Materials Advances_ [here](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2021/ma/d1ma00167a). She also contributed to three other projects in the group, including (i) simulation of xenon and krypton ton adsorption in porous organic cages, (ii) summarizing the literature on computational studies to discover new MOFs for capturing chemical warfare agents, and (iii) developing a mathematical framework to curate MOFs for gas sensor arrays. See her [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=uaHWcOoAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

## Arthur will enroll in the Mathematical, Computational, and Systems Biology (MCSB) PhD program at UC Irvine

Arthur York is officially headed to Irvine in the fall to pursue his PhD in Mathematical, Computational, and Systems Biology! Huge congratulations, Arthur!

Arthur writes Julia code to carry out molecular simulations of gases adsorbed in nanoporous materials. See Arthur's (first-theory-author) [JACS paper](https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b05872) and his [blog post describing it](https://simonensemble.github.io/2019-07/Mo-cage-viz). Also see his [blog post on Buffon's needle](https://simonensemble.github.io/2018-04/buffon).

## Mira will enroll in PhD program in Chemical Engineering at UC Berkeley

Mira Khare is officially headed to Berkeley in the fall to pursue her PhD in Chemical Engineering! Huge congratulations, Mira!

Mira started off working on convolutional neural networks to predict the transcription driving capacity of gene promoters. Later, she focused on simulating the adsorption of gas in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) to predict their performance for methane storage and xenon/krypton separations.
